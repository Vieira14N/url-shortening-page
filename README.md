## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Shrtcode API

### What I learned

When I started this challenge, I thought it'd be easy to develop with pure JS, so I choose React to challenge myself. I did a React course last year, after finishing it I didn't continue practicing, so I had to remender everything from React. So, I used react components, just that. I tried to apply some hooks, but I have to learn more about it and understand more how react words in the backstage. 

### Continued development

- More abour React
- React Hooks
- Redux
